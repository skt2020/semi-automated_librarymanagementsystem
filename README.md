# XENESIS Semi-automated library management system

# Version -1.2 (Beta)

# BETA version notice
This is an early preview and is neither perfect nor fully featured. This is a glimpse of our direction but may change quite a bit without notice.

You can use it to manage your appointments and more features will be added until we feel ready to have it take over the existing interface.

IMPORTANT: this is the admin side and NOT what your clients will see and use, which isn't changing yet.



# XENESIS
With the increase in the number of readers day by day in our institute SVVV,
better management of libraries system is required. The Library management system
focuses on improving the management of libraries in a city our institute. “What If
you can check whether a book is available in the library through your phone?” or
“what if instead of having different library cards for different libraries you can just
have one ?” or “you can reserve a book or issue a book from your phone sitting at
your home!”. The Integrated Library Management system provides you the ease of
issuing, renewing, or reserving a book from an library within your institute through
your phone. The Integrated Library Management system (LMS) is developed on
the library computer system with a website to support students logging in from
anywhere which basically focuses on issuing, renewing and reserving a book.
